## Description

This is challenge 04 of the UMN Bootcamp. Here I created a blog where the user can post blog posts using the form and it will stay saved within local storage. I used different strategies to retrieve an array of blog post objects from local storage and then for each post I manipulated the dom to render each post accordingly.
